Database systems typically have a large number of knobs that must be configured by database administrators and users to achieve high performance. RocksDB achieves fast data writing performance using a log-structured merge-tree. This database contains many knobs related to write and space amplification, which are important performance indicators in RocksDB. Write amplification decreases the database performance, whereas space amplification increases storage space owing to the storage of redundant data. Previously, it was proved that significant performance improvements could be achieved by tuning the database knobs. However, tuning multiple knobs simultaneously is a laborious task owing to the large number of potential configuration combinations and trade-offs.
